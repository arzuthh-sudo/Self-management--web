    <h2>Why is Self-Management Important?</h2>
    <p>Employers often look for candidates who can take charge of their own responsibilities. Self-management is crucial because it allows individuals to remain organized, complete work on time, and handle stress in a professional manner. Strong self-management improves productivity, reduces errors, and creates a positive reputation in the workplace.</p>
    <p>On a personal level, it helps individuals maintain balance, achieve goals, and stay motivated. Without self-management, even skilled workers may struggle to succeed because they lack discipline and control over their actions.</p>

    <h2>Core Elements of Self-Management</h2>

    <h3>1. Time Management</h3>
    <p>Time management is the ability to plan, organize, and prioritize tasks effectively. It helps individuals meet deadlines and balance multiple responsibilities. Using planners, digital tools, or simple to-do lists are effective ways to manage time.</p>

    <h3>2. Stress Management</h3>
    <p>Managing stress is an important part of self-management. Workplace challenges, deadlines, and personal pressures can create stress, but staying calm and composed helps in making better decisions. Techniques like deep breathing, meditation, and exercise can reduce stress.</p>

    <h3>3. Goal Setting</h3>
    <p>Self-management involves setting clear, realistic goals. Having short-term and long-term goals helps individuals stay focused and motivated. Goals act as a roadmap to success and encourage continuous improvement.</p>

    <h3>4. Adaptability</h3>
    <p>Being adaptable means being open to change and adjusting to new situations quickly. In a fast-changing work environment, adaptability is highly valued. It shows resilience and a willingness to learn.</p>

    <h3>5. Self-Motivation</h3>
    <p>Self-motivation is the drive to take initiative without external pressure. Motivated individuals are proactive, energetic, and determined to succeed. They inspire others and are often seen as leaders.</p>
